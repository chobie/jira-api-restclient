use chobie\Jira\Issues\Walker;

$api = new Api(
    'https://your-jira-project.net',
    new Basic('yourname', 'password')
);

// get issues from a JQL query
$walker = new Walker($api);
$walker->push(
	'project = "YOURPROJECT" AND (status != "closed" AND status != "resolved") ORDER BY priority DESC'
);

foreach ( $walker as $issue ) {
    var_dump($issue);
    // Send custom notification here.
}

// generic API call
$response = $api->api(Api::REQUEST_GET, '/rest/api/2/worklog/updated', ['since' => 1501076518]); // will return a chobie\Jira\Api\Result instance
